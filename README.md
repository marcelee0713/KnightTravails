This was really hard but the help of ChatGPT. I solved it with him.
But in the first attempt I really had a hard time understanding it.

It was because of the nodes having multiple edges/neighbors. Because in BST (Binary Search Tree).
The nodes have the maximum edges of two. So I have to learn Graphs and use BFS and DFS in it.

I also added practice_graph that's where I practiced it.
So the searching algorithm I did was BFS and I had a hard time understanding about the parent node thing.

But basically it was made purposely creating the path and the help of back tracking when we found the "end node".

That's pretty much it thank you ChatGPT!
